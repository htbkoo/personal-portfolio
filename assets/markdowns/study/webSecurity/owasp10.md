# OWASP 10

A temporary space to hold my study notes related to [`OWASP Top Ten`](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

## What is it?
- standard awareness document for developers and web application security
- broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications

### Top 10 Web Application Security Risks

#### 1. Injection
- occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of command or query
- hostile data could trick interpreter to execute unintended commands + access data without autheorization
- e.g. SQL, NoSQL, OS and LDAP injection

##### 

#### 2. Broken Authentication
